## Assignment 1
You can see [assignment 1](Assignment1_rrr180003) here. In this program there are quite a few features that can be found. Given a csv file with a set of 
values, we use NLP preprocessing techniques in order to change the data in order for it to be standardized in a manageable way. Afterwards, we then ask the user
to input the id so that the matching record is returned. We also use the pickle feature in order to print the contents of the newly processed csv.
